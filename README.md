# Libft - 42Prague
My very first own library


### **What is libft?**  
This project is about coding our own C library.
To do that, we had to recreate some basic C functions including some additional ones. 
Later we will use this library for other projects.
It is our first individual project in core curiculum at [42Prague](https://www.42prague.com/studies).
The goal of the project is to have a deeper understanding of data structures, basic algorithms and memory allocation.
