# Libft - 42Prague
My very first own library :classical_building:


### **What is libft?**  
This project is about coding our own C library.
To do that, we had to recreate some basic C functions including some additional ones. 
Later we will use this library for other projects.
It is our first individual project in core curiculum at [42Prague](https://www.42prague.com/studies).
The goal of the project is to have a deeper understanding of data structures, basic algorithms and memory allocation.


### **What functions are in the library?**

There are 3 sections:

1.  **Libc Functions:** Some of the standard C functions.
2.  **Additional functions:** Functions that are not in the libc, or that are part of it but in a different form.
3.  **Bonus Functions:** Functions useful for linked list manipulation.
